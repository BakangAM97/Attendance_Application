# Attendance Manager SpartaGlobal
## Summary
A web-based application for managing and monitoring attendance of the Sparta Global training schemes to be used internally by the Sparta Global management. A register of all employees attendance is kept daily to ensure trainees prompt arrival to work every day, preparing future consultants for the requirements of everyday working life and ensuring the continued high-quality services customers have come to expect from the Sparta Global team.

## Overview
**Trainees** can be created, updated, destroyed and assigned to a group/groups. **Training Groups** can be created, updated and destroyed. Attendance is monitored in one of two ways:

- When viewing an individual group a summary of each trainee's attendance is displayed.
- When viewing an individual trainee a week-by-week breakdown of their attendance is displayed.
